What are data structures, and why are they important?\n","    - Data structures are ways to organize and store data so you can use it efficiently. They are like containers or frameworks, like lists, dictionaries, or stacks, which helps in handling data in specific ways depending on what you need to do.\n","    - They are important because they make your programs faster and more organized.\n","2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n","    -  In Python, mutable means you can change the object after it's created, while immutable means you can't change the object, it's fixed once created.\n","    - Lists are mutable means the elements can be changed or elemnts can be appended or removed from the list.\n","    - while string are immutable means a string characters cant be changed once initialised and declared, appending or changing anything will end up in creating new object.\n","3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","    - lists are mutable whereas tuples are immutable\n","    - lists are comparatively slower while tuples arefaster than lists because they are fixed in size.\n","4.  Describe how dictionaries store data?\n","    - they store data in key-value pairs, where each key acts like a index and the value as its definition.\n","    - keys are unique identifiers and are immutable\n","5.  Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","    - When we want only unique items in our collection.\n","    - or when we need fast checks for membership or duplication.\n","    - or when we are performing operations like union or intersection between collections.\n","6.  What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","    - A string in python is a sequence of characters used to store text, while a list is a collection of items (which can be of any data type). They're both sequences, but they're different in how they behave and what they're used for.\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","    - Tuples help ensure data integrity in python because they are immutable. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added to, or removed.\n","8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","    - A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs and allows for very fast data retrieval. It works by using a hash function to compute an index (a hash code) for each key, which determines where the value is stored in memory.\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","    - yes, they are heterogenous\n","10.  Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n","    - Immutable strings greatly simplify memory allocation\n","    - if strings weren't immutable, you couldn't reliably use them as keys in a dict, since their hash value might suddenly change.\n","    - Python can optimize memory usage when it knows that strings won't change after they're created.\n","    - Immutability ensures that once a string is created, it can't be changed accidentally, which helps maintain data integrity.\n","11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","    - Dictionaries offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks, especially when you need fast access to data, want to associate keys with values, or need to avoid duplicates.\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","    - a good scenario would be if we are working with geographical data and need to store the coordinates (latitude, longitude) of a specific location. Since the coordinates shouldn't change once they're set, a tuple would be the ideal choice.\n","13.  How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","    - In Python, sets automatically handle duplicates by only allowing unique values. When you try to add a duplicate value to a set, it simply ignores the new value and doesn't add it again. This is because sets are designed to contain only one instance of each item.\n","14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","    - The in keyword in Python is used to check if a value exists in a collection.\n","    - in lists it searches for a value if it is present or not\n","    - while in dictionaries it serches for keys\n","15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","    - No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple in Python. Tuples are immutable, which means that once they are created, their elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.\n","16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","    - A nested dictionary is a dictionary where the values associated with some or all of the keys are themselves dictionaries. Essentially, it's a dictionary within a dictionary.\n","    - Let's say you need to store information about multiple students. For each student, you want to store their name, age, and a list of their courses. A nested dictionary can be used to represent this structure, where each student's details are stored as a dictionary, and all the student records are stored in a larger dictionary.\n","17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n","    - dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, which allows for very efficient access to elements. The time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary is generally O(1) on average, meaning it takes constant time, regardless of the size of the dictionary.\n","18.  In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","    - Lists are preferred over dictionaries in situations where order matters, where you need to store multiple duplicate values, or when you need to access elements by index rather than a key.\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","    - Dictionaries in Python are considered unordered because they do not maintain the order in which elements are inserted. This is because dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, where the keys are hashed to a specific memory location, and the data is stored based on the hash value, not the insertion order.\n","20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","    - Lists store elements in a sequential manner, meaning that each item is assigned an index starting from 0. To access a value in a list, you use the index of that item. Since the data is ordered, the index represents the position of the item in the list.\n","    - Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, each element in a dictionary is associated with a key, and the value is accessed by referring to its corresponding key.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qpdZCC-dNJWa"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"mq7SNP-QNBWp","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736842191131,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8846,"user":{"displayName":"Muhammad Abaan K.
